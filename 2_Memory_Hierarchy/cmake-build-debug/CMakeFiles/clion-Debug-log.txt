CMake Warning (dev) at /snap/clion/359/bin/cmake/linux/x64/share/cmake-3.31/Modules/FetchContent.cmake:1953 (message):
  Calling FetchContent_Populate(googletest) is deprecated, call
  FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest) instead.  Policy CMP0169 can be set
  to OLD to allow FetchContent_Populate(googletest) to be called directly for
  now, but the ability to call it with declared details will be removed
  completely in a future version.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMakeLists.txt:51 (FetchContent_Populate)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
